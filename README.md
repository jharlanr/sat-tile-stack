# sat-tile-stack
`sat-tile-stack` is a package for constructing deep learning-ready datasets from satellite imagery.  Built on `Microsoft Planetary Computer` and `stackstac `, `sat-tile-stack` enables users to compile time-series datasets at regular cadence (e.g., daily).  Functional options include tracking cloudiness, imagery availability, and spatial mask generation at that same cadence for ease of use in attention-enabled deep learning frameworks.
